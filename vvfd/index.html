<p>This is a VFD driver with hardware and software that can be used to find related grid and segment pins.
Finding these relationships saves a huge amount of manual work that would be required to implement a driver solution for a VFD with no documentation.
Lack of documentation is a common issue for VFD displays, since many of them were produced for only one product thus had no external documentation.
This is a university group project; I&rsquo;ve been designing the electronics, and my group mate has been designing the software.</p>
<p>To drive a VFD you need an alternating current for the filament, a high voltage for the anodes, and a means of switching the high voltage with digital logic.
To produce the alternating current, an H-bridge and timer was used.
The H-bridge uses 2 p-FETs and 2 n-FETs; this is different from the usual 4 n-FETs used for an H-bridge.
I did this because the filament H-bridge only switches 5 V; that would create 0 V gate-source voltage for the high-side MOSFETs when the H-bridge is on.
To create the high anode voltage (typically &gt; 12 V) I added a boost converter to the board with an output range of 10 - 30 V. To determine the component values, I simply followed the equations provided in the manufacturer&rsquo;s datasheet.
For routing, I tried to keep the high-current loops as small as possible, but this was difficult due to the large number of through-hole components (using through-hole is heavily incentivised by the uni).
Finally, a high-side p-channel switching array is used to switch the VFD grids and segments to the high boost converter voltage.</p>
<p>Current sensing is used to find related grid and segment pins.
The grids draw a high current (~700 uA), and the segments draw a low current (~40 uA).
Grids will always draw current when they&rsquo;re on, but the segments will only draw current if they&rsquo;re associated with any grid(s) that are currently active.
So the software can go through and find all the grid pins by checking for the high current.
Then the software can check all the segment pins and look for a small current increase to find which segments belong to which grids.
To detect these current changes with hardware the ground plane for the high-side switch ICs was isolated from the main ground plane.
Then the two ground planes can be connected with a resistor, and the voltage drop across that resistor will be proportional to the total current draw of the VFD&rsquo;s grids and segments.
Op-amps are used to amplify this voltage drop to a suitable level to get the full dynamic range out of the MCU&rsquo;s ADC.
There are two current-sensing circuits; one for sensing low currents and one for sensing high currents. They just have different current-sense resistors and op-amp gains.</p>
<p>This project is still a work in progress, my electronics design is done (I think), but we don&rsquo;t have any prototype boards or parts yet.
I have done some prototyping on breadboards though, see pictures below.</p>
